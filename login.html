          <h2 class="service">HOW WE SECURE DATA</h2>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our websites and mobile
            apps offer convenient access to our services and provide information
            about important opportunities and events organized by the Volunteer
            Connect. We collect information from online visitors directly or
            through third-party sources. This information is used to communicate
            with our supporters and clients and process their transactions. We
            do not share or sell this information to other organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you use our websites
            or apps to contribute financially, register for classes or events,
            volunteer, apply for jobs, purchase supplies, or schedule a donation
            appointment, we may ask for relevant details like your name,
            address, phone number(s), and transaction-related information.
            Financial donations, class payments, or purchases require standard
            credit card information.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also gather
            information about online visitors from external sources, assisting
            us in engaging with those interested in participating in Volunteer
            Connect activities or supporting our mission.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, we collect
            non-personal information through automated technologies like
            cookies, pixels, and web beacons. This helps us improve the online
            experience, enhance our websites, and understand visitor
            preferences. It enables us to identify popular website sections,
            visitor navigation patterns, and visit duration. If you prefer not
            to have information collected through cookies, you can disable this
            feature in your browser. However, please note that blocking cookies
            may limit personalized content and affect the optimal functionality

          <h2 class="service">HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We employ various
            security measures to safeguard your data. We have implemented
            physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to prevent
            unauthorized access and misuse of personally identifiable
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure the security of
            credit card transactions, we utilize multiple protective measures,
            including encryption, access controls, network firewalls, and
            physical security. These precautions significantly reduce the risk
            of interception or unauthorized access to your credit card
            information. When collaborating with other companies for credit card
            processing, they also employ encryption and suitable security
            measures.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While it is impossible to
            guarantee absolute security for websites and electronic data, we
            continuously strive to maintain current and appropriate security
            mechanisms to uphold the highest level of protection.
